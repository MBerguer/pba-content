# Price discovery methods (Auctions and DeFi) (~4 hours)

The broad aim is to discuss price setting mechanisms, both traditional and on blockchains.
_Perhaps we reframe this section to be about 'exploits in game theory' or 'Price discovery/prediction markets'. We should not teach DeFi in this module at all. Automated Market Makers could be used in this module._

### Why is this important

Price discovery is one of the most important aspects in economics. Auctions, as most prominent device, are applied in Polkadot's parachain allocation system.

A key concept of traditional auctions, order books, are hard to implement on blockchains, which is why people have come up with, e.g., automated market makers. Decentralized finance is undoubtedly one of the most powerful and important areas of decentralized applications. As mentioned, it is imperative to build incentives correctly, otherwise users will find a way to exploit the system in any way possible to make money.

### Prerequisites

- Basic economic concepts
- Game theoretical concepts

### Learning Outcome

The goal is to give an introduction into traditional price-finding mechanisms: auctions and order books.
We introduce DeFi and some related topics in algorithmic game theory and mechanism design.

### Learning Objectives

Students...

- can design a simple auction and know why they are a very efficient way to discover prices.
- can distinguish between different auction designs and detect bad design decisions.
- evaluate the results of the real-world outcomes of the parachain candle auctions.
- will have an overview on alternative price discovery methods.
- will understand the main types of DeFi apps that can be implemented, and good rules of thumb on how to develop them.

## Lecture (1 hour)

Slides: [2.3-Price_Finding_Mechanisms_slides.md](./2.3-Price_Finding_Mechanisms_slides.md)

### Activity (~1 hour)

_Can we have learners play Modern Art (the auction card game) as part of this section?_

- Playing a candle auction on your own (can also vary activity rules), also a hard-closing auction with discrete time steps (to see sniping behaviors).
- Experiment, Analysis of data, seeing if it was efficient - Compare it to the real polkadot auctions (graphs)
- Examples of real life hacks & ill-designed incentives. We could split people in teams, each team analyzes one famous hack, does investigative work reading news from the Internet, finds what exactly went wrong, and presents to the other teams.

## Econ Games: (~2 hours)

- FIXME what one(s)?
